            <h2 class="secheading" >Adventure Time!!</h2>
            <p class="text">An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky. Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports. Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained by such activities.
                <br><br>Adventure books may have the theme of the hero or main character going to face the <a class="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness" target="_blank">wilderness</a> or <a class="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Nature" target="_blank">
                Mother Nature</a>. Examples include books such as <a class="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatchet_(novel)" target="_blank">Hatchet</a> or <a class="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Side_of_the_Mountain" target="_blank">My Side Of Mountains</a>. These books are less about
                "questing", such as in mythology or other adventure novels, but more about surviving on their own, living off the land, gaining new 
                experiences, and becoming closer to the natural world.

                To be fit and healthy you need to be physically active. Regular physical activity can help protect you from serious diseases such as obesity, heart disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and arthritis. Riding your bicycle regularly is one of the best ways to reduce your risk of health problems associated with a sedentary lifestyle.
                <br><br>
                Cycling is a healthy, low-impact exercise that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, from young children to older adults. It is also fun, cheap and good for the environment.
                <br><br>
                Riding to work or the shops is one of the most time-efficient ways to combine regular exercise with your everyday routine. An estimated one billion people ride bicycles every day – for transport, recreation and sport.

                <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is a type of extreme sport found in the early 1980s by people interested in aerial sports, and it allows one to run off the slopes with free parachutes. Paragliding is generally more accessible than other extreme sports since it does not require a special take off or a landing track. Paragliding is also the fastest developed air sport in the world.
                <br><br>
                First you have to take the parachute to the hill where you will make your jump. Be aware that the weight of parachute can vary between 6-15 kg. When you climb up the hill, all you need is a paragliding wing. As the paragliding pilot, you should be careful to make sure that the field is not obstructed by anything such as trees or structures. The paragliding pilot should run down the hill, and there is no need to run too fast because the wind will help enough already. The type of sports parachute used in paragliding is designed for easier take off and landing. 
                <br><br>
                It is always a better choice to learn from someone prevalent in the sports. And thanks to the paragliding courses in various places, you can easily bring this extreme sport to your life.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Surfing is usually associated with warm ocean beaches like those found in the U.S. states of Hawaii and California, and countries such as Australia. Surfers, however, do not limit themselves to warm weather or ocean waves. Surfers dust a foot of snow off their surfboards to chase waves off the coast of Antarctica. They trek through jungles to pristine beaches in Southeast Asia. They share the water with great white sharks in South Africa. They even ride the “silver dragon,” the giant tidal bore of China's Qiantang River.
                <br><br>
                Surfing is possible in all these places because the concept is simple. A breaking wave, a board and a brave athlete are all that is needed for the sport. (Sometimes, you don't even need the board. This is called bodysurfing.)
